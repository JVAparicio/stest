Simple test
=====

Simple practical test.

Try to improve as much as possible the code.

The main method (the rest is just entities an object value):
https://github.com/uniplaces/stest/blob/master/src/Uniplaces/STest/ListingFinder.php

Don't change tests, the only exception is the construction of objects if you desire (but without breaking the tests):
https://github.com/uniplaces/stest/blob/master/tests/Uniplaces/STest/Tests/FindListingsTest.php#L171

If you can try to make possible to add new specifications to the Finder without directly touch Finder code. Also any hard coded value in ListingFinder should be able easily configured.
